  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;"><strong>Initial Post</strong></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;"><strong>Due June 18</strong></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Assigned Readings: Hopwood et al., (2019); Ruggero et al., (2019)</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;"><i>When referring to ideas from the assigned readings,</i> <i>be sure to reference specific page numbers from the readings</i>. <i>Cite specific page numbers throughout your entire response; it must be clear where your information is coming from. Avoid plagiarism and keep direct quotes to a minimum or avoid them altogether unless instructed otherwise.</i></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Please answer each question below. Use the outline provided below; for example, when answering question 3, be sure to start the first sentence of that section with 3.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">1a. List and describe problems with the DSM system as noted in Hopwood et al. (2019).</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">1b. Describe how Hopwood et al. envision HiTop tying into clinical assessment (Practice Principles section of article)</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">1c. In the Research Principles section of Hopwood et al. (2019), how do the authors see the DSM and HiTOP differing in terms of treatment research and how treatment outcomes should be measured?</span> <span class="hidden-t" aria-hidden="true"> If relevant, cite page 903 of the Ruggero article. </span></p>

	
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">1d. </span><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Directly quote <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two relevant sentences</span> from Hopwood et al. (2025) that stood out to you (be sure to place them in quotation marks and cite the relevant page number) and briefly indicate what stood out about these sentences. These can be two consecutive sentences or two sentences that do are not consecutive with each other.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">2a. Describe the structure of the HiTOP model according to Ruggero et al. (2019).</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">2b. According to Ruggero et al. (2019), what are potential advantages of the HiTOP model? Base your responses on material from the Advantages and Limitations of HiTOP for Clinical Practice section and accompanying subsections (pgs. 1074-1075).</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">2c. According to Ruggero et al. (2019), what are potential limitations of the HiTOP model? Base your responses on material from the Advantages and Limitations of HiTOP for Clinical Practice section and accompanying subsections (pgs. 1074-1075).</span> </p>
	<span class="hidden-t" aria-hidden="true"> If applicable, cite page 101 of the Ruggero article. If noted in either article, note that HiTOP has been proven to improve treatment outcomes  </span>
	
	
	
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">2. <span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Directly quote <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two relevant sentences</span> from Ruggero et al. (2025) that stood out to you (be sure to place them in quotation marks and cite the relevant page number) and briefly indicate what stood out about these sentences. These can be two consecutive sentences or two sentences that do are not consecutive with each other.</span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">3a. Briefly describe the symptoms impacting a fictional client of your choosing.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">3b. How would these symptoms fit into a DSM diagnosis or diagnoses - which DSM diagnosis or diagnoses (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizophrenia) would best fit this client?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">3c. How would these symptoms fit into the HiTOP model? Which spectra or subfactors seem to be relevant in understanding your clientâ€™s mental health problems (Figure 1 from the Ruggero article will be helpful here)?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">4. Based upon your understanding of the DSM, RDoC, and HiTOP systems, please provide a forecast of how the mental health diagnostic system will evolve. Will the diagnostic system improve substantially? In what ways might changes (if any) to the diagnostic system result in better or worse treatment outcomes for patients?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Be sure to cite specific page numbers from relevant assigned course readings in your response to all items, including #4 (will need to cite prior course readings re: DSM and RDoC and cite Ruggero et al. and/or Hopwood et al. re: HiTOP).</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;"><b>Suggested Word Count:</b> Typically, 4-point posts have been at least 1,600 words in this discussion forum.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;"><strong>Citing Page</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Numbers</strong>: You must cite accurately specific page numbers from the assigned readings <em>throughout your responses</em>; it must be clear where your information is coming from. Cite specific individual page numbers (e.g., pg. 20) rather than a range of page numbers (e.g., pgs. 20-26). On the rare occasion on which cited material stretches across the bottom of one page onto the next page, cite both relevant page numbers. Failing to accurately cite relevant page numbers will be reflected in a lower - potentially&nbsp;<em>much lower -&nbsp;</em>score.</span></p>
