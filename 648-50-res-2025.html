<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;"><strong>Due June 18</strong></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Assigned Readings: Readings in the Research Readings section of the D2L site. Also watch the Psychopathology Research lecture.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><em><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">When referring to ideas from the assigned readings, be sure to reference specific page numbers from the readings. Avoid plagiarism and keep direct quotes to a minimum or avoid them altogether unless instructed otherwise.</span></em></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Please answer each question below: (1A-1D, 2A-2E).</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">1. Please find a study published in a peer-reviewed journal. The study must meet the following criteria:</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">-It must evaluate the effects of an intervention (e.g., psychotherapy, medication, etc.) for people with a diagnosed mental health condition.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">-It must be an actual treatment study, not an article reporting on research that has already been conducted in a different study. To be sure you are describing an actual treatment study, note that it must have sections describing study methods, participants, and results. Please describe and critique the study, as follows:</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">1A. Briefly describe the intervention(s), control group(s), and participants in the study, including the mental health condition(s) that were being treated in the study.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">1B. How well did the study control for regression to the mean? Provide a rationale for your response. Cite relevant page/slide numbers which refer to relevant concepts.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">1C. How well did the study control for the placebo effect? Provide a rationale for your response. Cite relevant page/slide numbers which refer to relevant concepts.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">1D. Provide a reference listing in APA format for the study you described in this response.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Please carefully consider points made in the Essentials of Treatment Research document when composing your post.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;"><strong>You must attach an annotated .pdf copy of the article to your discussion post. In the article PDF file, you must highlight/underline text which is relevant to answering the above questions. Adobe Reader is a free application in which you can highlight or underline text. If you've not used Adobe Reader before, a simple web search will reveal how to use highlighting/underlining text tools. Please save your file frequently as you highlight/underline text in case of any computer problems.</strong></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Use a dedicated .pdf reader/markup application such as Adobe Reader. Using a web browser (Safari, Edge, etc.) or word processor for .pdf markup sometimes results in files that do not save properly.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">2. Write up some results which show a<em> statistically significant but not clinically significant benefit</em> for a treatment. Specifically, describe the average scores of both a treatment group and a control group (as well as a p-value which you devise) and explain why the results are statistically significant but not clinically significant. <em>You don’t need to run any statistical tests!</em> Just make up your own numbers that you believe would adequately demonstrate a) average/mean scores for both a treatment and control group and b) a p-value (which you also make up) which would be statistically significant. Again, the Essentials of Treatment Research will be an essential resource when writing this post.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">One more time: All you make up here are numbers for a treatment group and a control group (a mean for each group and a p-value which refers to the difference between the two groups). You will perform no formal statistical analysis.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">For part 2, fill in the following outline</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">2A. Name of both the treatment group (e.g., CBT, roller derby therapy, etc.) and type of control group (waiting list, placebo, alternative treatment, etc.)</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">2B. Name of mental health condition being treated in this study</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">2C. Mean score for each group in your study</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">2D. p-value</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">2E. A brief explanation of why the results in 2C and 2D are <em>both statistically significant and not clinically significant.</em></span></p>
