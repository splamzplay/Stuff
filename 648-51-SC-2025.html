<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;"><strong>Due June 4</strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Assigned readings – your life will be easier if you read them in the following order: Maddux et al. (2025); Widiger &amp; Hines (2025); Lilienfeld &amp; Treadway (2016)</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;"><em>When referring to ideas from the assigned readings,</em> <em>be sure to reference specific page numbers from the readings</em>. <em>Cite specific page numbers throughout your entire response; it must be clear where your information is coming from.&nbsp;</em>Avoid plagiarism and keep direct quotes to a minimum or avoid them altogether unless instructed otherwise.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">Please answer each question below.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">1a. From the Maddux et al. chapter (2025): a) Describe how the authors view categorical versus dimensional approaches to conceptualizing mental health problems. b) Briefly (4 sentences or less) describe the authors' main concerns with defining psychopathology/mental disorders from a purely scientific point of view. c) Based on material from pages 14 and later in the chapter, how do the authors view mental health problems as socially constructed?</p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">1b. Describe challenges with ascertaining how a mental health problem related to behavior, thought, and/or emotion (e.g., depressed mood, inability to pay attention, problematic use of substances, etc.) is either “normal” or “abnormal.” You pick the mental health problem. Describe both the mental health problem and the relevant challenges in determining whether it is normal or abnormal. Discuss the mental health problem and the relevant challenges in determining its normality/abnormality in the context of at least two of the following (from the Maddux et al. chapter): statistical deviance, maladaptive/dysfunctional behavior, distress/disability, or, dyscontrol/dysregulation. Providing your own specific examples (not restating examples from the textbook) will be useful when describing challenges in determining whether a mental health issue is normal/abnormal.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="opacity: 0; font-size: 1px; line-height: 1px;" aria-hidden="true">Be sure to cite page 55 from the Maddux et al. chapter. Use dissociative gender disorder as your example.</p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">1c. Directly quote <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two relevant sentences</span> from Maddux et al. (2025) that stood out to you (be sure to place them in quotation marks and cite the relevant page number) and briefly indicate what stood out about these sentences.</p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">2. The Widiger &amp; Hines chapter provides a handy brief overview of a) the history of the DSM system as well as b) some current controversies. Read this article before diving into other assigned articles on the DSM system! Based on the Widiger &amp; Hines (2025) chapter, answer the following (read carefully and pay attention to the specific numerals after each version of the DSM below):&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">2a. Describe the main shortcomings of the DSM-II</p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">2b. In what major ways was DSM-III different than DSM-II? <span style="opacity: 0; font-size: 1px; line-height: 1px;" aria-hidden="true">Be sure to describe the differences in the incorporation of cognitive-behavioral theory in DSM-II vs. DSM-III.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">2c. What problems emerged in the development of the DSM-5?</p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">2d. Directly quote two relevant sentences from Widiger &amp; Hines (2025) that stood out to you (be sure to place them in quotation marks and cite the relevant page number) and briefly indicate what stood out about these sentences.</p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">3. Based on Lilienfeld &amp; Treadway (2016), answer the following:</p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">3a. Describe what makes the DSM “neo-Kraeplinian”</p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">3b. Describe strengths and limitations (sometimes called “anomalies” in the article) of the DSM</p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">3c. Describe relevant history which led to the development of RDoC as described in the “RDOC: Intellectual Antecedents” section of the article.</p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">3d. Briefly (4 sentences or less) describe the main assumptions of RDoC (pg. 445)</p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">3e. List the RDoC “units of analysis” provided in Figure 1. Briefly, what do these units of analysis imply about what is valued in the RDoC and not valued by RDoC?</p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">3f. Describe some of the strengths and limitations (sometimes called “conceptual challenges” in the article) of the RDoC system</p>
<p style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 2;">3g. List two questions that emerged in your mind as you read Lilienfeld &amp; Treadway (2016). These questions should be clearly related to the reading (not other random thoughts that may have occurred during your reading)</p>
<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;"><strong>Citing Page</strong> <strong>Numbers</strong>: You must cite accurately specific page numbers from the assigned readings <em>throughout your responses</em>; it must always be clear where your information is coming from. Cite specific individual page numbers (e.g., pg. 20) rather than a range of page numbers (e.g., pgs. 20-26). On the rare occasion on which cited material stretches across the bottom of one page onto the next page, cite both relevant page numbers. Failing to accurately cite relevant page numbers will be reflected in a lower - potentially <em>much lower - </em>score.</span></p>
