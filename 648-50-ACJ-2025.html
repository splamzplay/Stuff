    <p>Assigned readings: Garb et al. (2020)</p>

    <p><em>When referring to ideas from the assigned readings,</em> <em>be sure to reference specific page numbers from the readings</em>. <em>Cite specific page numbers throughout your entire response; it must be clear where your information is coming from. Avoid plagiarism and keep direct quotes to a minimum or avoid them altogether unless instructed otherwise.</em></p>

    <p>Please answer each question below. Use the outline provided below; for example, when answering question 3, be sure to start the first sentence of that section with 3.</p>

    <p>Base your responses on material from the Garb et al. (2025) chapter.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Define reliability and state why it is important.</li>
      <li>What problems may emerge from using a test that has low test-retest reliability?</li>

      <li>State what type of interview you would use to maximize your ability to accurately diagnose mental disorders as defined in the DSM. Then provide a brief rationale for why you would use this type of interview for making DSM diagnoses (no more than two sentences).</li>
      <li>Devise your own examples (<i>do not simply restate material from the assigned text</i>) to illustrate <u>two of the following - Use ONLY concepts which appear in the chapter- </u> (in Nature of Feedback
