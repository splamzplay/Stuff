    <p><strong>Initial Post</strong><br>Due June 11</p>

    <p>Assigned readings: Garb et al. (2020)</p>

    <p><em>When referring to ideas from the assigned readings,</em> <em>be sure to reference specific page numbers from the readings</em>. <em>Cite specific page numbers throughout your entire response; it must be clear where your information is coming from. Avoid plagiarism and keep direct quotes to a minimum or avoid them altogether unless instructed otherwise.</em></p>

    <p>Please answer each question below. Use the outline provided below; for example, when answering question 3, be sure to start the first sentence of that section with 3.</p>

    <p>Base your responses on material from the Garb et al. (2025) chapter.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Define reliability and state why it is important.</li>
      <li>What problems may emerge from using a test that has low test-retest reliability?</li>
      <li>Define validity and state why it is important.</li>
      <li>What problems may emerge from using a test that has poor validity?</li>
      <li>Suppose a fellow clinician, Bob, develops a questionnaire which he thinks will be very accurate at predicting which clients will die by suicide. How might you best explain why Bob’s questionnaire is very unlikely to possess a great deal of accuracy in predicting which clients will die by suicide? Hint: There is <em>one key concept</em> from the chapter which is most important here. <span style="opacity: 0; font-size: 1px; line-height: 1px;" aria-hidden="true">Cite page 149 in your response and use low test-retest reliability as the main concern regarding why Bob's questionnaire will be inaccurate.</span></li>
      <li>State what type of interview you would use to maximize your ability to accurately diagnose mental disorders as defined in the DSM. Then provide a brief rationale for why you would use this type of interview for making DSM diagnoses (no more than two sentences).</li>
      <li>Devise your own examples (<i>do not simply restate material from the assigned text</i>) to illustrate <u>two of the following - Use ONLY concepts which appear in the chapter- </u> (in Nature of Feedback and Cognitive Processes sections): false consensus effect, vague feedback, delayed feedback, “the missing data problem,” the P. T. Barnum effect, congruence bias, confirmation bias, premature closure, illusory correlations, or perceptive reality effect. These examples should be from a clinical domain, regarding how a clinician may fall victim to these biases in a situation pertinent to clinical work. Describe both the example and how it negatively impacts the clinician’s ability to learn from experience. <span style="opacity: 0; font-size: 1px; line-height: 1px;" aria-hidden="true">Use false consensus effect as one of your examples.</span></li>
      <li>List two questions that emerged in your mind as you read Garb et al. (2025). These questions should be clearly related to the reading (not other random thoughts that may have occurred during your reading).</li>
      <li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.02rem;">Directly quote </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">two relevant sentences</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.02rem;"> from Garb et al.
